    The Dodge Charger is a model of automobile marketed by Dodge in various forms over eight generations since 1966.

The first Charger was a show car in 1964.[1][2] A 1965 Charger II concept car resembled the 1966 production version.[3]

In the United States, the Charger nameplate has been used on mid-size cars, personal luxury coupes, subcompact hatchbacks, and full-size sedans.

    The 1975 model year Charger continued as a B-body car and was restyled in an effort by Dodge to move the model into the growing personal luxury car market segment.

In 1978, Dodge added the Magnum to that segment. A Daytona model fourth-generation Charger featured stripes that ran along the length of the car.

    For the 2012 through 2018 model years, the Super Bee platform (Later called Scat Pack 15+) was available,
     using features seen in regular SRT-8 models with accessories and badges reminiscent of the 1960s and 1970s muscle car.
