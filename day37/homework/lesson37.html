        <p style="color: yellow;">  The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a massive, nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma,
          <br>
           heated to incandescence by nuclear fusion reactions in its core, radiating the energy from its surface mainly
           <br>
            as visible light and infrared radiation with 10% at ultraviolet energies. It is by far the most important 
            <br>
            source of energy for life on Earth. The Sun has been an object of veneration in many cultures. It has been a 
            <br>
            central subject for astronomical research since antiquity.
