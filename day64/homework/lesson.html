        McLaren Racing Limited (/məˈklærən/ mə-KLARR-ən) is a British motor racing team based at the McLaren Technology Centre in Woking,
         Surrey, England. The team is a subsidiary of the McLaren Group, which owns a majority of the team.
          McLaren is best known as a Formula One chassis constructor, the second-oldest active team and the second-most successful
           Formula One team after Ferrari, having won 186 races, 12 Drivers' Championships, and eight Constructors' Championships.
            McLaren also has a history in American open wheel racing as both an entrant and a chassis constructor,
             and has won the Canadian-American Challenge Cup (Can-Am) sports car racing championship.

        In 1981, McLaren merged with Ron Dennis' Project Four Racing; Dennis took over as team principal,
         and shortly afterwards organised a buyout of the original McLaren shareholders to take full control of the team.
          This began the team's most successful era; with Porsche and Honda engines, Niki Lauda, Alain Prost,
           and Ayrton Senna won seven Drivers' Championships between them and the team took six Constructors'
            Championships. The combination of Prost and Senna was particularly dominant—together they won all but one race in 1988—but
             later their rivalry soured and Prost left for Ferrari. Fellow English team Williams offered the most
              consistent challenge during this period, the two winning every constructors' title between 1984 and 1994.
